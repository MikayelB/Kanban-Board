# To Start The Application

In the terminal go to the root of the application

Install dependencies by running:

`npm install`

Run JSON Server (this keeps the task information locally instead of an actual DB):

`json-server -w ./server/data.json` if for some reason this doesn't work run the following command `npm install -g json-server` and retry

Start the application by running:

`npm run dev`
